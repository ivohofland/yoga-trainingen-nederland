/**
 * Quad state → semantic class + NL label.
 *
 * THE rule of this project (spec §4, CLAUDE.md): `not_published` and `unknown`
 * must never render identically.
 *
 *   not_published — we looked; the provider does not state it. A FINDING.
 *   unknown       — we have not looked yet. A GAP in our own research.
 *
 * The class encodes HOW WELL WE KNOW something. It never encodes whether the
 * answer is good: `coherence_signals.modules_sold_separately: "yes"` is not
 * praise, and `accreditation.verified: "no"` is a fact, not an accusation.
 *
 * An absent optional object (undefined/null) is a gap, not a finding — an
 * un-investigated field is not an omission by the provider.
